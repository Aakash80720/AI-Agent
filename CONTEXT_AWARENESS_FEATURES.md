# Context-Aware SQL Agent Features

## Overview
The SQL Agent has been enhanced with advanced context awareness capabilities that allow it to learn from user interactions and provide more intelligent, personalized responses.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ðŸ§  Conversation Context Tracking
- **Operation History**: Tracks all user operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Table Usage**: Monitors which tables are used most frequently
- **Recent Queries**: Stores last 20 queries with timestamps
- **Last Operation Context**: Remembers the most recent operation details

### 2. ðŸŽ¯ User Pattern Recognition
- **Preferred Departments**: Learns which departments the user works with most
- **Common Salary Ranges**: Tracks typical salary values entered
- **Frequent Operations**: Identifies the user's most common database operations
- **Column Usage**: Tracks which columns are used frequently

### 3. ðŸ”— Contextual Query Enhancement
- **Reference Resolution**: Understands "that record", "last entry", "same department"
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides context-based recommendations
- **Query Personalization**: Tailors queries based on user patterns
- **Similar Record Detection**: Suggests criteria for finding similar data

### 4. ðŸ’¡ Intelligent Suggestions
- **Department Auto-fill**: Suggests commonly used departments
- **Salary Recommendations**: Provides salary range suggestions
- **Related Actions**: Suggests follow-up operations
- **Pattern Insights**: Shows user behavior patterns

### 5. ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced UI Features
- **Context Insights Panel**: Shows recent operations and patterns in sidebar
- **Smart Quick Actions**: Context-aware buttons for common operations
- **Contextual Hints**: Displays relevant tips based on recent activity
- **Operation History**: Visual timeline of recent database operations

## Implementation Details

### Core Classes Enhanced

#### SQLAgent Class
```python
# New methods added:
- update_conversation_context()     # Updates context after operations
- get_context_suggestions()         # Provides contextual suggestions
- enhance_query_with_context()      # Enhances queries with context
- get_personalized_prompt()         # Creates personalized prompts
```

#### Chat Class
```python
# New methods added:
- get_context_insights()           # Retrieves user insights
- generate_and_execute_final_query_node()  # Enhanced with context updates
```

### Context Data Structure
```python
conversation_context = {
    "last_operation": str,          # Last database operation
    "last_table": str,              # Last table accessed
    "last_values": dict,            # Last inserted/updated values
    "operation_history": list,      # List of all operations
    "table_usage_count": dict,      # Usage count per table
    "recent_queries": list,         # Last 20 queries
    "user_patterns": {
        "preferred_departments": list,
        "common_salary_ranges": list,
        "frequent_operations": list
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Contextual References
```
User: "Insert employee John Doe in Engineering with salary 75000"
AI: [Inserts record and updates context]

User: "Show me that record"
AI: [Automatically resolves to show John Doe's record]
```

### 2. Department Context
```
User: "Show employees in the same department"
AI: [Uses context to filter by Engineering department]
```

### 3. Pattern-Based Suggestions
```
User: "Add another employee"
AI: "I notice you frequently work with Engineering department. 
     Would you like to add an employee there?"
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Faster Queries**: Reduced need to repeat information
- **Intelligent Assistance**: AI remembers preferences and patterns
- **Contextual Help**: Relevant suggestions based on activity
- **Seamless Workflow**: Natural conversation flow

### For Database Operations
- **Reduced Errors**: Context helps validate operations
- **Improved Efficiency**: Smart auto-completion and suggestions
- **Better UX**: More intuitive interaction model
- **Learning System**: Gets better with more interactions

## Testing

Run the context awareness test:
```bash
python test_context_awareness.py
```

This will verify:
- Context tracking after operations
- Contextual query resolution
- Pattern recognition
- Suggestion generation
- Operation history maintenance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning for better pattern detection
2. **Cross-Session Memory**: Persistent context across application restarts
3. **Multi-User Context**: User-specific context isolation
4. **Natural Language Understanding**: Better intent recognition
5. **Predictive Suggestions**: Anticipate user needs based on patterns
